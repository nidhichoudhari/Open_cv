# üîç Feature Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains implementations of key image processing techniques using **OpenCV** in Python:

- **Harris Corner Detection**
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**
- **Edge Detection using Canny and Sobel**

These techniques are essential in computer vision tasks like object recognition, image stitching, and feature matching.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization in some notebooks)

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
